# Portal 2 Dialogue Cues and Notes
 
 
All elevator cues that are not marked otherwise have an error range of about Â± a syllable.
For elevator cues, it is better to enter the elevator a bit late than a bit early (although try to enter on-time).
There is a quick list at the end of the singleplayer part of the document that can be snapped to the side of a screen while speedrunning.
Co-op fades right now are just copy-pasted from the other coop fades doc.  I will update them eventually.
